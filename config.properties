    The guideline is:
    - key is the HTTP/HTTPS adress of the page from which articles will be sourced
    - entry body contains semicolon seperated args that'll be used by jsoup for matching 
        - REQUIRED: source name - not a matcher
        - REQUIRED: article container (all the next matches will be performed in this container)
        - REQUIRED: element containing article URL
        - REQUIRED: article title
        - article sub-title
        - article matcher - the only one where .first() is not called on the selector
    - non-REQUIRED can be skipped
    - for matcher syntax, consult https://jsoup.org/cookbook/extracting-data/selector-syntax
